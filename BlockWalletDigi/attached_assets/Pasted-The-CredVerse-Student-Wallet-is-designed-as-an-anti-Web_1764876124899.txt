The CredVerse Student Wallet is designed as an anti-Web3, student-first digital identity vault that combines the simplicity of Apple Wallet, the trust of DigiLocker, and the modern feel of LinkedIn certificates, while silently running advanced blockchain, DID, and verifiable credential infrastructure underneath. The design follows a clean, minimal interface built with a white-blue-black palette, using Primary Blue #0055FF, Deep Black #000000, Soft White #F7F9FC, Verified Green #00D26A, and Warning Red #FF4545. When students open the app, they first see a lightweight splash screen with the CredVerse logo gently scaling upward, reinforcing speed and trust. The login experience is intentionally familiar—using phone number or email OTP, and optionally Google login—with no mention of crypto wallets, keys, or blockchain. Behind this simple login, a DID is silently generated and stored securely without the user noticing.

After login, the user lands on the main wallet home dashboard, which centers around a prominent student profile card showing their name, photo, and CredVerse ID, with a verified badge if their university is linked. Below the card is a row of quick-access buttons—My Credentials, Share via QR, Add Credential, and Settings—allowing students to reach key actions with a single tap. The lower half of the screen features a dynamic activity feed that displays newly issued credentials, revocation alerts, and verification updates. When students navigate to “My Credentials,” they see a scrollable list of certificate cards, each displaying the credential title, issuing university logo, issuance date, and a large green verified tick. This list can be filtered by type, year, institution, or verification status, and works fully offline with a small indicator.

Opening an individual credential takes the student to the detailed certificate screen—the heart of the wallet experience. Here, the full certificate preview is displayed at the top, followed by verified status indicators, issuer identity, timestamps, and essential metadata. The student can instantly share the credential using one of four actions: generating a QR code, downloading a PDF, sharing a link, or using selective disclosure (SD-JWT) to hide sensitive fields. The QR sharing interface is intentionally dramatic: a full-screen dark background, a glowing white QR code, and options to download or share through WhatsApp or other apps, creating a premium verification moment. The selective disclosure screen allows students to toggle which fields employers can see—such as hiding grades while showing degree title—providing privacy control without requiring technical knowledge.

The wallet also includes an “Add Credential” flow where students can import documents by scanning a QR, uploading a PDF, pulling from DigiLocker, or syncing with university systems. The settings section offers biometric login, PIN creation, backup and recovery, device management, language options, and an advanced mode for tech-savvy users. Micro-interactions throughout the wallet—such as pulsing verified ticks, lift-on-touch animations, and smooth card transitions—give the app a polished, modern feel that rivals global fintech products.

Security is deeply embedded but minimally visible: biometric authentication, PIN lock, encrypted local storage, AES-256 protection, silent DID management, and automatic credential syncing to secure cloud storage. No PII is stored on-chain; instead, only hashed anchors are committed to Polygon to ensure integrity without compromising privacy. All complex Web3 operations—VC-JWT validation, SD-JWT creation, DID management, and on-chain proof-checking—happen in the background with no user friction. The wallet is built as a PWA using Next.js and Tailwind/shadcn UI, ensuring fast load times, offline capability, add-to-home-screen installation, and universal compatibility across devices.


Overall, the CredVerse Student Wallet is designed to be the world’s simplest yet most powerful academic identity wallet—modern, intuitive, secure, privacy-centric, and fully compliant with global standards like W3C VC, DID, SD-JWT, and DigiLocker specifications. It hides all complexity and delivers a smooth, trustworthy experience that students love, employers rely on, and universities adopt confidently.
